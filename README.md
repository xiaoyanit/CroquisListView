CroquisListView
===============

This is a replacement of Android default ListView.
So, you can add any features that Android framework does not support.

First depth means the API version to build.
Second depth means the code's origin.
For example, 'api8/gingerbread' means that
a ListView from Android Gingerbread branch runs on Froyo.

Disabled code is marked by //! or /\*!.

You must replace 'yourapp.R's with real one.
